**Actions**

**Martial Spellcaster** If Glasya casts a spell using her action, roll a d8.  If the result is greater than the level of the spell slot used, she may immediately make a multiattack.  This ability automatically succeeds if the spell was a cantrip. 

**Multiattack** Glasya may attack three times.

**Fire Blades** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (2d8+6) slashing damage plus 6 (1d10) fire damage. 

**Flame Darts** Thrown Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, range (50ft./150ft.), single target.  Hit: 15 (2d8+6) piercing damage plus 6 (1d10) fire damage.

**Reactions** 

**Armor of a God** In reaction to an attack coming from a creature within 10 ft., Glasya may turn her diving contenance on the attacker.  The attacker must make a DC 20 Constitution save or be blinded until the beginning of their next turn.  If they are blinded it happens before the triggering attack (and they must make it at a disadvantage for being blinded).

**Legendary Actions**
A princess of hell growing into god-hood, Glasya has 3 legendary actions.  She may use one at the end of another creature's turn.  She regains her legendary actions at the beginning of her own turn.

**Lesser Spellcaster (Costs 1 Action).** Glasya casts a 3rd level spell or lower.

**Hell's Fury (Costs 1 Action).** Glasya immediately makes one attack with her Fire Blades or Flame Darts.

**Greater Spellcasting (Costs 2 Actions).** Glasya casts a 5th level spell or lower.

**Infernal Step (Costs 3 Actions).** Glasya casts Misty Step without using a spell slot.  While she is in transit between the two locations a fireball (3rd level, as if cast by Glasya) detonates at her starting or final location. 

**Lair Actions**
Glasya is slowly becoming a god and shifting the City of Doors to suit her needs.  Within the boundries of the Armoury she may use lair actions.  On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties) Glasya takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

Infernal Vines: 1d4 creatures within 20ft. of Glasya must pass a DC 20 strength save or be restrained until the next lair action phase.

Gale of Souls: All hostile creatures within 20ft. of Glasya must make a DC 18 strength save or be knocked prone and take 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

The Fires of Hell: All creatures within 20 ft of Glasya make a DC 20 Constitution save.  Any that fail become vulnerable to fire.  If they are resistant to fire they lose their resistance, and if they are immune to fire they become resistant to it.  This effect ends at the start of the next lair action phase.

Infernal Vortex: Up to six creatures within 20ft. of Glasya take slashing damage equal to her intelligence modifier (7).
