**Phase.** Time Elementals can move by altering the flow of time, seeming to disappear from one location and re-appearing in another.  Moving in such a way does not provoke an attack of opportunity

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The elemental makes two touch attacks.

***Touch.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) force damage.

***Time Prison (Recharge 4-6).*** A creature adjacent to the elemental's space must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 13 (2d8 + 4) force damage and becomes attached to the elemental by temporal energies.  A creature so attached is considered grappled (DC 13 Escape Check).  Until this grapple ends the target is considered restrained.  Additionally, it cannot affect its position, since the Time Elemental can simply teleport to another location.  The Elemental can grapple two medium creatures or one large creature at a time.  At the start of the elemental's turn any grappled creatures suffer 13 (2d8 + 4) force damage from time's pressure.  A creature adjacent to another creature grappled in this way can attempt to pull them out as an action (DC 15 Strength check).  If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half damage.
