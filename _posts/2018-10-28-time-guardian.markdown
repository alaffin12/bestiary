**Antimagic Susceptibility.** Because the Time Guardians is coaleced elemental time within the physical form of a suit of armour, it is particularily vulnerable to effects that disrupt magic.  An anti-magic field disables it completely (while it is within the field's effect) and, if targeted with a dispel magic spell, it wil be forced to make a Constitution save versus the casters DC or be disabled for one minute.  A DC 20 Inteligence (Arcana) check reveals this weakness.

**Shielded Mind.** The time guardian is immune to scrying and any effect which would sense its emotions, read its thoughts or detect its location.

**Legendary Resistance (3/day)** If the Time Guardian fails a saving throw it can choose to succeed instead.

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The guardian makes two melee attacks or one ranged attack.

***Sword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 29 (2d12 + 16) bludgeoning damage.

***Temporal Bolt*** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 300 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (8d6) lightning and 28 (8d6) force damage.

**Legendary Actions**  The Time Guardian gets one legendary action, which can be used at the end of any combatant's turn.  Legendary actions recharge at the start of the Time Guardian's turn.

***Temporal Weapon.*** The Time Guardian can mark an enemy, making them extra vulnerable to their sword.  This creature takes an extra 7 (2d6) lightning and 7 (2d6) force damage from every hit until they are knocked unconciouss or the Time Guardian chooses a new target (which requires a second legendary action).

***Time's Pressure.*** The Time Guardian releases a burst of temporal energy, forcing everyone to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.  Those who fail the throw are paralyzed until either the guardian releases them, or they take damage.

**Lair Actions** 
***Barrage*** At the start of the Time Guardian's turn roll 1d6.  On an even number, nothing happens.  On an odd number, a wave of temporal energy sweeps the room throwing debris and the players around.  Players must make a DC 15 Dexterity Save.  If they fail they take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage (from random debris) and 7 (2d6) force damage (from the temporal wave) and are moved 15 ft in a random direction (roll 1d8 to determine direction - if they are blocked they take an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 5 ft. they have left to move).  On a successful save they take 1/2 damage and are not moved.
