***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Yeenoghu fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** Athanaious makes seven attacks, five with his double bladed greatsword, and two with his fists:

***Double Bladed Greatsword (+2).*** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d6+10) slashing damage.

***Fists.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (1d8+8) bludgeoning damage.

**Reactions**

***Parry.*** Athanaious adds 9 to his AC against one melee attack that would hit him.  To do so, Athanaious must see the attacker and must be wielding his +2 double greatsword.

***Slam.*** If a creature makes an attack against Athanaious and misses, Athanaious can use his reaction to attempt to turn his attacker's momentum against him.  He makes a fist attack, however if he is successful the attacker is knocked prone instead of taking damage. 

**Bonus Actions**

***Call Sword.*** While his sword is flying, Athanaious can use his bonus action to move his greatsword up to 60 ft. and catch it wil an empty hand.

**Legendary Actions**

Athanaious can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.  Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.  Athanaious regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Attack.*** Athanaious makes a greatsword or fist attack.

***Whirlwind Blade.*** If Athanaious is holding his +2 double-bladed greataword he can use his legendary action to throw it (like a boomerang) at a target he can see within 30 ft. of him.  The target must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6+10 damage.

If the blade is otherwise still in the air he may make it move 60 ft, or may move it 30 ft. to attack a foe.

If the greatsword does not return to Athanaious before the end of his next turn, it falls to the ground in its current location and must be picked up before it can be used again.

***Mighty Blow (Costs 2 Actions).*** Athanaious makes a fist attack.  If the attack hits, the target takes damage as normal, is knocked back 10 ft. and falls prone in its space.  It must make a DC 21 Constitution save - if it fails, the target is stunned until the start of Athanaious' next turn.

***Overpower (Costs 3 Actions).*** Athanaious breaks free of any nonmagical restraints or creature that has him grappled.  If he is restrined by magical means that offer a save against their effect at any time, he is able to make that save again with advantage.  Once free, he can move up to his full movement speed.
